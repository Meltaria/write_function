```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

## Do something simple

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec))/sd(x_vec)
```

I want a function to compute z-score

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("Input must be numeric")
  }
  
  if(length(x)<3){
    stop("Input must have at least three numbers")
  }
  
  z = (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
  
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x_vec)
```

try my function on some other things. THese should give errors 
```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(3)
z_scores("my names is Yuchen")
z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

```
